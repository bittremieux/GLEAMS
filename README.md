GLEAMS is a Learned Embedding for Annotating Mass Spectra.
GLEAMS encodes mass spectra as vectors of features and feeds them to a neural network to embed them into a 32-dimensional space in which spectra generated by the same peptide are close together.
It then detects spectrum clusters of spectra generated by the same peptide.

The software is available as open-source under the BSD license.

If you use GLEAMS in your work, please cite the following publication:

Installation
------------

GLEAMS requires Python 3.8, a Linux operating system, and a CUDA-enabled GPU.

1. Create a Conda environment and install the necessary compiler tools and GPU runtime:
```
conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bittremieux/GLEAMS/master/environment.yml && conda activate gleams
```
2. Install GLEAMS:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/bittremieux/GLEAMS.git
```

Using GLEAMS

For detailed usage information, see the command-line help messages:

```

gleams cluster --help
```

### Spectrum embedding

GLEAMS provides the `gleams embed` command to convert MS/MS spectra in peak files to 32-dimensional embeddings. Example:

```
gleams embed *.mzML --embed_name GLEAMS_embed
```

This will read the MS/MS spectra from all matched mzML files and export the results to a two-dimensional NumPy array of dimension _n_ x 32 in file `GLEAMS_embed.npy`, with _n_ the number of MS/MS spectra read from the mzML files.
Additionally, a tabular file `GLEAMS_embed.parquet` will be created containing corresponding metadata for the embedded spectra.

### Embedding clustering

After converting the MS/MS spectra to 32-dimensional embeddings, they can be clustered to group spectra with similar embeddings using the `gleams cluster` command. Example:

```
gleams cluster --embed_name GLEAMS_embed --cluster_name GLEAMS_cluster --distance_threshold 0.3
```

This will perform hierarchical clustering on the embeddings with the given distance threshold.
The output will be written to the `GLEAMS_cluster.npy` NumPy file with cluster labels per embedding (`-1` indicates noise, minimum cluster size 2).
Additionally, a file `GLEAMS_cluster_medoids.npy` will be created containing indexes of the cluster representative spectra (medoids).

### Advanced usage

Full configuration of GLEAMS, including various configurations to train the neural network, can be modified in the `gleams/config.py` file.
