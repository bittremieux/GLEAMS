GLEAMS is a Learned Embedding for Annotating Mass Spectra.
GLEAMS encodes mass spectra as vectors of features and feeds them to a neural network to embed them into a 32-dimensional space in which spectra generated by the same peptide are close together.
It then detects spectrum clusters of spectra generated by the same peptide.

The software is available as open-source under the BSD license.
